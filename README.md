# Weather App

This is my take on the weather app. It makes use of the openweathermap.org api
I'm using Gatsby 

I built three searchbox components:
- `simpleSearch.js` tries to implement autocomplete from a json file. It's too slow!
- `typeaheadSearch.js` does it a little better for some obscure reason (I `npm install`ed it from the web)
- `search.js` uses google places api. It works wonders!

There's a lot yet to be done if you're reading this from the future!
